Shared code
====================
Shared codes (V5 menu **Configuration/Shared code**,V6 menu **Business objects/Shared code usage**) can be used to create code that can be used by different objects.  

They have various uses, including  
* To create new Java classes and therefore create specific tools.  
* Completing the behaviour of certain base classes (classes inheriting from ObjectDB), in particular the PlatformHooks authentication class.  
* Set up unit tests  
* Create specific SQL codes for data recovery, for example.
