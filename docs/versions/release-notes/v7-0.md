- Removed outdated Java libs:
  - `commons-discovery`

- `FeatureFlag.TRUNCATE_TOO_LONG_TEXT` is set to `false` by default.

### Docker images

There is no impact if you use out of the box images.

If you customize these images at Tomcat level there might be some impacts because the version 7.x images are using Tomcat 11 which
configuration files may slightly differ from Tomcat 9 used in previous versions' images.
Make sure to review, and potentially adapt, your customization Dockerfiles.

### SimplicitÃ© Instances Manager (SIM)
