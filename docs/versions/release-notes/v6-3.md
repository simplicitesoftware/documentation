Version 6.3 release note
========================

> **Warning**: This release note corresponds to a **future** minor version which is still in **ALPHA** stage and thus in active development.
> <br/>**ALPHA** stage means it is **absolutely not yet suitable** for production

Technical documentation
-----------------------

All the technical documentation is available from the [platform website](https://platform.simplicite.io), in particular:

- the [JavaDoc](https://platform.simplicite.io/6.3/javadoc/)
- the [JSDoc](https://platform.simplicite.io/6.3/jsdoc/)

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

### Development mode

Some development-oriented features are now **only available** when the instance is started in "development mode"
(which is enabled by passing the `platform.devmode=true` JVM argument
or by setting the `DEV_MODE` environment variable in the Docker containers):

- the `devinfo` APIs (used by our VSCode plugin)
- the `/maven` embedded Maven repository

As a reminder, this was already the case for the Java code formatting which requires some additional JVM capabilities to be enabled.

Deprecations
------------

Deprecated features to be removed in the next releases

### ECJ Java compiler

The platform now uses the **Eclipse Java Compiler** (ECJ) instead of the JDK compiler.

This is transparent and more efficient. It also allows to deploy the platform on a JRE instead of a JDK keeping Java custom code compilation possible.

> **Reminder**: Java compilation can be explicitly enabled or disabled using the `server.compiler` JVM argument (defaults to `true`)
> which is driven by the `COMPILER` environment variable in our Docker images.

The compiler options can be customized if needed using the `JAVA_COMPILER_OPTIONS` system parameter which is provided as `-g -warn:unused,deprecation` in order
to make more visible (as warnings) all deprecated usages and unused variables/methods in the custom code (not that compilation warnings
are non blocking but should be fixed).

The list of possible compiler options are described [in the Eclipse documentation](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-using_batch_compiler.htm).

Features
--------

New features for the end-user

### New search on list

- a) Indexed/fulltext search can be displayed at the top of the list
- b) Full search on dialog (or docked on left) is a separated button (no more toggle between search modes)
- c) Search by column is a small toggle button in the columns header
- d) A specific search bar can be added to the top or side of the list

Maker Experience
----------------

Features enhancements for the designer

### Improved annotations

All annotations now include a `desc` attribute that can be used to document the related class/method.
New annotations have also been added to annotate the business and external objects' hooks.

### Mermaid widget

A new configurable external object allows to display Mermaid charts.

E.g.
![](img/v6-3/mermaid.png)

### "Go to definition" generalization

New contextual buttons to go to the component's definition, available for:
- View
- Crosstab
- Activity
- Timesheet
- TreeView
- External object

### New object search settings

- a) 4 new properties to allow search on list (column, dialog, docked, index)
- b) preview of indexed fields when the object is indexable
- c) allows to edit a search-bar template added to the list

![](img/v6-3/objsearch.png)

Edit search template on list:

### Module Git

The legacy `ModuleGIT` external object has been removed. Its features are now available on the `ModuleCommit` business object linked to the `Module` object.

This business object now displays the Git tag(s) of each commit and a new row-level action allows to put a tag on a given commit (the push action now also pushes the tags):

Technical
----------

Technical enhancements and features

### UI console

New global variable `$console`, by default:
- uses the default navigator `console`
- `$console.error` logs the stack trace + UI alert
- `$console.info|log|warn` can be overridden

`$app.info|warn|error...` are still accessible but it is strongly recommanded to use `$console`.

### Server side events

New servlet `/ui/sse` (asynchronous) to push messages from server to clients thru https

Example to bind a `myEvent` message:

1) Server side:

```java
ServerSideEvent.push("myEvent", new JSONObject().put("info","hello"), userId);
```

userId: null to notify all registered clients or a specific user.

2) Client side: simply add an event listener on `ui.ready`

```javascript
$ui.sse.addEventListener("myEvent", e => {
	let d = JSON.parse(e.data);
	console.log("myEvent message: " + d.info + " at time = " + d.time);
});
```

Predefined server side events:
- `ping`: simple ping thru SSE
- `close`: close the SSE connection
- `reset`: reopen the SSE connection
- `sysparam`: new system parameter flag to push changes from `grant.setParameter("MYPARAM","value")` to client in `$ui.sysparams.MYPARAM="value"`
- `objparam`: push an object parameter to UI in `obj.locals.MYPARAM`
- `enumCounters`: refresh counters in menu when enum or status has changed during save

### Improvements on external objects

#### Server side

- Added `getFilename` hook for `ExcelDocumentExternalObject` (and legacy `PDFDocumentExternalObject`)

#### Client side

- Improved JS class `Simplicite.UI.ExternalObject`:
  - Set metadata `(name, id, URL)` + business object context if any
  - Added `getResourceURL` function to get URL of external object's resources
  - Added `service` function to call server-side `service` hook

### Floating date search

New filter syntax with offset on date or datetime from today's date.
- `[DATE<:offset>]`
- `[DATETIME<:offset>]`
- `offset` = a signed number with unit ('y'ears, 'm'onths, 'w'eeks, 'dw' days no week-end, 'd'ays, 'h'ours, 'm'inutes, 's'econds, 'ms')

Examples

```java
// last 3 months
fieldDate.setFilter(">=[DATE:-3m]");
// in next 15 days
fieldDate.setFilter(">=[DATE] and <=[DATE:15d]");
// before next 12 hours
fieldDatetime.setFilter("<[DATETIME:+12h]");
```

This syntax can be used in predef-search of views/home page.

### Custom health check

Added a new `customHealthCheck` platform hook for custom health check, e.g.:

```java
@Override
public void customHealthCheck(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, boolean minimal) throws Exception {
	AppLog.info("Custom health check called from " + request.getRemoteAddr());

	ServletTool.success(request, response, new JSONObject()
		.put("status", "OK")
		.put("date", Tool.toDatetime(new Date())));
}
```

### Improved OpenAPI/Swagger schemas

The OpenAPI/Swagger schemas of generic APIs have been improved to comply with stricter compliance rules:

- Added missing descriptions on definitions (business objects, errors, ...).
- Added missing `maxLength` constraints for string type attributes in OpenAPI schemas

### Improved mapped API external object configuration

- Added generic mapping capabilities with case conversions, e.g.

```json
{
	"name": "My mapped API",
	"objects": [ "DemoSupplier", "DemoProduct" ], // or "modules": [ "Demo" ]
	"objectsCase": "pascal",
	"fieldsCase": "snake",
	"pathsCase": "kebab"
}
```

- Made `/ping` operation optional (using `"ping": true|false` in configuration, `true` by default for backward compatibility) and added associated `ping` hook
- Added optional `/health` operation (using `"health": true|false` in configuration, `false` by default for backward compatibility) with associated `health` hook

### Added restrictions in development mode only

Some features are now restricted to development mode only.

This development mode is enabled by the `server.devmode=true|false` JVM argument (positioned by the `DEV_MODE` environment variable in Docker containers)

- `devinfo` services (e.g. used by VSCode plugin) are now only accessible in this mode

### Changed scope of helper methods

The `ObjectCore.(re)setAllFields*` helper methods used to iterate on all fields except technical fields (row ID and timestamp fields).

This is an issue in v6 where the characteristics of referenced fields may have an influence on the object behavior
(e.g. setting them updatable means the referenced record can be updated from the referring object).

These referenced fields are thus now also ignored in these helper methods.

### Major version check at module import

A module exported from a higher major version for the platform (e.g. from the future major version 7)
will now be refused for import as it may cause unexpected results.

Importing modules exported from lower major version is still supported.

### New front hooks beforeSave and afterSave

`Simplicite.UI.BusinessObject` contains 2 new hooks:

```javascript
/**
 * Front hook before calling Ajax object.save()
 * @param ctn Form container
 * @param obj Object (same as this)
 * @param index record index (edit list)
 * @param cbk callback(true|false) (must return 'true' to continue or 'false' to stop/reject promise)
 */
beforeSave(ctn, obj, index, cbk) {
	cbk && cbk(true);
}

/**
 * Front hook after calling Ajax object.save()
 * @param ctn Form container
 * @param obj Object (same as this)
 * @param index record index (edit list)
 * @param cbk callback(true|false) (must return 'true' to continue or 'false' to stop/reject promise)
 */
afterSave(ctn, obj, index, cbk) {
	cbk && cbk(true);
}
```

NB: previous hooks `form.beforesave` and `form.beforesave` are still available but it is recommended to use the class BusinessObject.

### Mail service configuration

It is now possible to override the `MAIL_SERVICE` system param by a same name environment variable (or the equivalent `mail.service` JVM property)

It is also now possible ti use YAML syntax instead of JSON for this configuration.

### Maven skip tests

The `skipTests` Maven property is now set by default in the `pom.xml` files of the module.
The reason is that in the great majority of cases the unit tests are supposed to be processed within a live SimplicitÃ© instance, not locally.

It it however possible to change this behavior by explicitly setting the `"skipTests": false` in the `"maven: {...}"` block of the module's settings.
In this case you should be able to launch unit tests locally if non of them need to be processed within a live SimplicitÃ© instance.

### Improvements of the generic OpenIDConnect provider

The additional authorize URL parameters `acr_values` and `prompt` parameters are now supported in the `AUTH_PROVIDERS` system parameter.

The `nonce` string used by the protocol has also been increased with some additional randomness.

### New configuration items

- Added `[ROOT]`, `[URL]`, `[ENV:<environment variable name>[:<default value>]]` and `[PROP:<JVM property name>[:<default value>]]` substitutions in expressions
- Added the above `[ENV:]` and `[PROP:]` substitutions in module settings
- Added the above `[ENV:]` and `[PROP:]` substitutions in **loaded** values of system parameters
  (this does not apply to raw system parameter values read from the database using `Grant.getSystemParam("...")`)
- Added the possibility to override a system parameter by an environment variable named `SIMPLICITE_SYSPARAM_<system param name>`
  (this applies only to **loaded** values of system parameters)

### New helper methods

- `ServletTool.success(request, response, JSONObject)` for success (HTTP code 200) responses
- `PDFTool.getText(File|bute[])` to extract raw text content of a PDF document

### Images in excel exports

An experimental feature allows to include images in excel exports, although it comes with the following limitations:

- image anchoring does not work as expected (images don't follow the lines/columns when reordering)
- images adapt to default row size, which is quite small
- it can severely affect the exported file size, so image inclusion will be made optional in the future

In the meantime, it can be activated through the system parameter `FEATURE_FLAGS`

```json
{
  "images_in_excel_exports": true
}
```

![alt](img/v6-3/images_in_excel_exports.png)

### Custom disposition simplification

A new  `StaticSiteExternalObjectDisposition` custom disposition helper class has been added.

The principle of this class is to store the credentials (auth token and Ajax key) in the browser's session storage and redirect to a "static site" external object.
If this external object uses the frontend JS lib (of version 3.1.*+) these credentials are automatically used to retrieve the current's session grant.

The low level `HTMLTool` class has been improved to provide disposition-related get resource methods.

An implicit rewrite has been added from `*/` to `*/index.html` in "static site" external object contents.

### Others

- The tesseract.js JS lib  has been integrated to provide with basic client-side OCR
