- Updated jQuery, Bootstrap, AceEditor and FullCalendar

- Added simplified date interval search filters syntax for REST/JSON services e.g. `"myDateField": "2016-01-01,2016-12-31"`
- Added new grant hook `GrantHooks.customAuth(request, response)` that can be used to handle a custom authentication mechanism (custom SSO, ...)
  see. [this document](/lesson/docs/authentication/tomcat-customauth) for details
- Removed Flash&reg; charts (system parameter `FLASH_CHARTS` is removed)
- Refactored URL schemes for main page components, business objects pages and workflows pages (see [this document](/lesson/docs/versions/upgrading) for details)
- Light and dark background-friendly loading GIFs

  Note that this hook is not called when an object document field is inlined in a data webservice call)

- Added `GOOGLE_API_KEY` system parameter for Google APIs key
- Upgraded TinyMCE to latest version (4.4.3)

Fixes
-----

- Ajax lib methods `documentURL`, `imageURL`, ... fixed to include user token and fixed grant issue on raw document services
- Fixed bug on boolean filters in API calls
- Fixed encoding issues on search validation messages
- Added missing `ALM_ADMIN` group to `ADMIN` group profile
- Fixed unappropriate usage of `of` SQL99 reserved word as table alias in some platform's core requests
- Prevented unwanted password autocompletion in change password form
- Fixed bug on apply changes on web zones
- Added `{MD5}` at the beginning of hashed passwords when using base 64 encoding (system parameter `HASH_PASSWORD` = `BASE64`)
  NB: when migrating from a previous version using base 64 encoding you should alter manually the encoded passwords directly
  in the database by `update m_user set usr_password = '{MD5}' || usr_password where usr_password is not null`
- Fixed credentials management on remote Simplicit√© objects
- Fixed clear user token action
- Fixed internal Cron to execute only one daemon per application and JVM
- Fixed handling of advanced `[EXPR:(...)]` actions' and external objects' URL
- Fixed misinterpretations of `[<field name>]` syntax (instead of `[VALUE:<field name>]`) in complex expressions
- Fixed asynchronous calls to `setParameter`
- Fixed generic UI's asynchronous object deletions when business objet is not using form
- Fixed NPE when grant is null on `JSONServlet`
- Fixed edit list: display error messages on rows and continue saving rows after the first row in error
- Fixed some missing credentials options on some jQuery Ajax calls
