### Easy Mode
 
We have created a all new login call `easymode` with a simpler interface and actions. 

Screenflows has been released to support this easy mode. They will bypass some optional steps with default values.

* Object creation
* Field creation
* Link creation
* User creation

It will give you a quick preview what can be done with Simplicit√©.

We provide you all documentation and tutorial in the `easymode` home page for you to create an app in 10 minutes.
