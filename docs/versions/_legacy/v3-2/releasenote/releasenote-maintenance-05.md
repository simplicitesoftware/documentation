- Updated jQuery, Bootstrap, AceEditor and FullCalendar

- Added simplified date interval search filters syntax for REST/JSON services e.g. `"myDateField": "2016-01-01,2016-12-31"`
- Added new grant hook `GrantHooks.customAuth(request, response)` that can be used to handle a custom authentication mechanism (custom SSO, ...)
  see. [this document](/lesson/docs/authentication/tomcat-customauth) for details
- Flash&reg; charts marked as deprecated and outdate, this means this feature will be fully removed in next version
- Light and dark background-friendly loading GIFs

- Added `GOOGLE_API_KEY` system parameter for Google APIs key
- Upgraded TinyMCE to latest version (4.4.3)
- Scope request: force a valid scope when the requested scope is not granted
- Optimization: usage of the `Simplicite.Ajax` singleton instead of new instances

- XML Import of object with a state-model: do not force the initial state and import the requested state

  (the legacy URL syntax `<root>/content?file=<static file relative path>` is kept for backward compatibility but its use is deprecated)

- Added possibility to use `CONTENT` file set resource to configure per-disposition static content files (accessibles in the `/content/<disposition name>` public path)
- Added module import by cloning/pulling from a remote Git repository
- Changed CSS inclusion order so as to include objects' and processes' `STYLES` resource in last position (allowing to override core and disposition styles without the need of `!important`)
- Added business object hook `getMappedFilePath` to get a custom path for files during exports
- Replaced _TxtMark_ markdown Java lib by _CommonMark_, if you only use the `MarkdownTool` wrapper (which you should) this change is transparrent
